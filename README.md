NB - These images are for the Android Pie, 4 GB version of the phone. Contents are largely self-explanatory. If installing TWRP, it is necessary to flash an empty vbmeta image (vbmeta_patched.img) to disable Android Verified Boot, otherwise you risk a boot loop. Note that TWRP does not provide access to the /data partition, due to encryption restrictions.
