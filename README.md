These images are for the Android Pie, 4 GB version of the Oukitel WP5 rugged phone. Contents are largely self-explanatory. NB. If installing TWRP, it is necessary to flash an empty vbmeta image (vbmeta_patched.img) to disable Android Verified Boot, otherwise you risk a boot loop. Note that this TWRP version does not provide access to the /data partition, due to encryption restrictions, but there are many other methods for accessing user apps and data. A copy of the stock recovery image is provided in case anything goes wrong!
